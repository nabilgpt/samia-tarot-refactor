# 🔐 SAMIA TAROT - Payment RLS Policies Setup Guide

## 📋 Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies for payment tables in SAMIA TAROT platform.

## 🎯 What This Setup Does

### ✅ Security Features
- **Enables RLS** on all payment tables (`payment_settings`, `payment_gateways`, `payment_regions`)
- **Super Admin**: Full CRUD access to all payment tables
- **Admin**: Read and Update access only (no create/delete)
- **Other Roles**: Restricted access (no access to sensitive payment data)
- **Authenticated Users**: Read-only access to `payment_regions` for country detection

### 🛡️ Protection Features
- Prevents data leakage between roles
- Blocks unauthorized access to payment configurations
- Maintains audit trail with migration history
- Provides verification and testing functions

## 🚀 Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Execute Main RLS Setup
```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire content of database/payment-rls-policies-setup.sql
-- into your Supabase SQL Editor and run it
```

### Step 2: Run Validation Tests
```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire content of database/test-payment-rls-policies.sql
-- into your Supabase SQL Editor and run it
```

### Step 3: Verify in Frontend
- Login as Super Admin → Check Payment Settings panel
- Login as Admin → Verify read/update access
- Login as other role → Confirm no access

## 📊 Expected Results

### After Step 1 (Main Setup):
```
✅ Row Level Security enabled on all payment tables
✅ payment_settings policies created
✅ payment_gateways policies created  
✅ payment_regions policies created
📊 Total policies created: 10
🎉 PAYMENT RLS POLICIES SETUP COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
```

### After Step 2 (Validation):
```
✅ RLS Status: Checked
✅ Policy Count: Verified
✅ Policy Details: Listed
✅ Role Access: Validated
✅ Migration History: Confirmed
✅ Security: Validated
🚀 Payment RLS system is ready for production!
```

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Check RLS Status
```sql
SELECT * FROM verify_payment_rls_policies();
```

### Test Role Access
```sql
-- Test Super Admin access
SELECT * FROM test_payment_table_access('super_admin');

-- Test Admin access
SELECT * FROM test_payment_table_access('admin');

-- Test Client access (should be restricted)
SELECT * FROM test_payment_table_access('client');
```

### View Migration History
```sql
SELECT * FROM migration_history 
WHERE migration_name = 'payment_rls_policies_setup_v1';
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: 403 Permission Denied
**Cause**: User role not properly set or JWT token issues
**Solution**: 
1. Check user role in `profiles` table
2. Verify JWT token contains correct role
3. Ensure user is authenticated

### Issue: Policies Not Working
**Cause**: RLS not enabled or policies not created
**Solution**:
1. Run the test script to verify setup
2. Check if RLS is enabled: `SELECT rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'payment_settings';`
3. Re-run the main setup script

### Issue: Admin Can't Update
**Cause**: Missing update policy or role mismatch
**Solution**:
1. Verify admin role in database
2. Check update policies exist
3. Ensure JWT contains correct role

## 📋 Role Permissions Summary

| Role | payment_settings | payment_gateways | payment_regions |
|------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Super Admin** | ✅ Full CRUD | ✅ Full CRUD | ✅ Full CRUD |
| **Admin** | ✅ Read/Update | ✅ Read/Update | ✅ Read/Update |
| **Authenticated** | ❌ No Access | ❌ No Access | ✅ Read Only |
| **Other Roles** | ❌ No Access | ❌ No Access | ❌ No Access |

## 🔧 Integration with Existing System

### ✅ Safe Integration
- **No UI Changes**: All changes are backend/database only
- **Theme Preserved**: Cosmic/dark neon theme untouched
- **Existing APIs**: All current API endpoints continue to work
- **Auto-Population**: Works seamlessly with payment methods auto-population

### ✅ Production Ready
- **Zero Downtime**: Can be applied to live system
- **Rollback Safe**: Policies can be dropped if needed
- **Audit Trail**: All changes logged in migration_history
- **Testing Included**: Comprehensive validation scripts

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Run the test script first
2. Check the troubleshooting section
3. Verify user roles and authentication
4. Review the migration history logs

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know the setup is successful when:
- ✅ Super Admin can see all payment methods in dashboard
- ✅ Admin can view and update payment settings
- ✅ Other users cannot access payment configuration
- ✅ No 403 errors in browser console
- ✅ Payment methods auto-population works
- ✅ All test scripts pass without errors
