# M37 — WCAG 2.2 AA Accessibility Checklist

## Overview
This checklist ensures compliance with WCAG 2.2 AA standards for the Samia Tarot platform. All items must be verified before production deployment.

## ✅ Keyboard Navigation & Focus Management

### Tab Order & Navigation
- [ ] Logical tab order follows visual layout
- [ ] No keyboard traps (users can navigate out of all components)
- [ ] Skip links available to main content (`#main-content`)
- [ ] Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements
- [ ] Arrow key navigation in dropdown menus and lists

### Focus Indicators
- [ ] `:focus` styles have ≥3px outline with 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- [ ] Focus indicators visible against all backgrounds
- [ ] Custom focus rings using `--cosmic-primary` color
- [ ] Focus styles preserved when using `focus-visible`

### Interactive Elements
- [ ] All buttons accessible via keyboard (Enter/Space)
- [ ] Modal dialogs trap focus properly
- [ ] Dropdown menus close on Escape key
- [ ] Form inputs navigable with Tab/Shift+Tab

## ✅ Color Contrast & Visual Design

### Text Contrast Ratios
- [ ] Normal text: ≥4.5:1 contrast ratio
- [ ] Large text (18pt+/14pt+ bold): ≥3:1 contrast ratio
- [ ] UI components: ≥3:1 contrast ratio
- [ ] WCAG-compliant colors used (`--*-wcag` CSS variables)

### Color Usage
- [ ] Information not conveyed by color alone
- [ ] Error states include text/icons, not just red color
- [ ] Success states include text/icons, not just green color
- [ ] Focus indicators sufficient without color dependence

### High Contrast Support
- [ ] `@media (prefers-contrast: high)` styles implemented
- [ ] Maximum contrast colors for high contrast mode
- [ ] Border visibility enhanced in high contrast mode

## ✅ Screen Reader Support

### ARIA Labels & Descriptions
- [ ] All interactive elements have accessible names
- [ ] Complex components use appropriate ARIA roles
- [ ] Form inputs associated with labels (`for`/`id` attributes)
- [ ] Error messages linked with `aria-describedby`

### Live Regions
- [ ] Dynamic content changes announced to screen readers
- [ ] Loading states communicated via `aria-live` regions
- [ ] Success/error messages use appropriate `aria-live` priority
- [ ] Language changes announced with `aria-live="assertive"`

### Semantic HTML
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- [ ] Lists use `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` elements
- [ ] Buttons use `<button>` not `<div>` with click handlers
- [ ] Links use `<a>` elements with `href` attributes

## ✅ Forms & Input Accessibility

### Form Structure
- [ ] All inputs have associated labels
- [ ] Required fields marked with `required` attribute
- [ ] Error messages use `role="alert"` and `aria-live="polite"`
- [ ] Field hints connected with `aria-describedby`

### Input Validation
- [ ] Real-time validation doesn't interrupt typing
- [ ] Error messages descriptive and actionable
- [ ] Success states clearly indicated
- [ ] Form submission feedback provided

### Custom Components
- [ ] Custom inputs implement ARIA patterns correctly
- [ ] Dropdown menus use `role="menu"` and `role="menuitem"`
- [ ] Toggle buttons use `aria-pressed` attribute
- [ ] Expandable content uses `aria-expanded`

## ✅ Language & Internationalization

### Document Language
- [ ] `<html lang="ar">` attribute set correctly
- [ ] Language changes update document language dynamically
- [ ] Content language meta tags present
- [ ] Direction attributes (`dir="rtl/ltr"`) set properly

### Multilingual Content
- [ ] Content in multiple languages marked with `lang` attribute
- [ ] Font stacks support Arabic and Latin scripts
- [ ] Text direction handled correctly (RTL/LTR)
- [ ] Placeholder text translated appropriately

## ✅ Images & Media

### Alternative Text
- [ ] All content images have descriptive `alt` text
- [ ] Decorative images use `alt=""` or `aria-hidden="true"`
- [ ] Complex images have long descriptions
- [ ] Icons include screen reader text or `aria-label`

### Media Controls
- [ ] Video players have keyboard-accessible controls
- [ ] Audio content has text alternatives or transcripts
- [ ] Autoplay disabled or user-controlled
- [ ] Media doesn't cause seizures (≤3 flashes per second)

## ✅ Motion & Animation

### Reduced Motion
- [ ] `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` implemented
- [ ] Essential animations only when reduced motion preferred
- [ ] Infinite/looping animations can be paused
- [ ] Parallax effects disabled for reduced motion users

### Animation Controls
- [ ] Users can pause/stop animations
- [ ] Auto-advancing content has controls
- [ ] Hover animations don't interfere with focus
- [ ] Loading animations include text alternatives

## ✅ Responsive Design & Mobile

### Touch Targets
- [ ] Minimum 44x44px touch targets
- [ ] Adequate spacing between touch targets
- [ ] Touch targets don't overlap
- [ ] Swipe gestures have alternatives

### Mobile Navigation
- [ ] Mobile menu accessible via keyboard
- [ ] Screen reader navigation works on mobile
- [ ] Zoom up to 200% without horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Content reflows properly at all zoom levels

## ✅ Testing & Validation

### Automated Testing
- [ ] axe-core accessibility tests pass
- [ ] WAVE web accessibility evaluation passes
- [ ] Lighthouse accessibility score ≥90
- [ ] HTML validates without errors

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Complete keyboard navigation test
- [ ] Screen reader testing (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver)
- [ ] High contrast mode visual review
- [ ] Color blindness simulation testing

### User Testing
- [ ] Users with disabilities can complete key tasks
- [ ] Feedback from accessibility consultants incorporated
- [ ] Common assistive technology compatibility verified
- [ ] Performance acceptable on older devices

## ✅ Performance & Technical

### Loading & Rendering
- [ ] Critical content loads without JavaScript
- [ ] Progressive enhancement implemented
- [ ] Focus management during loading states
- [ ] Loading indicators accessible to screen readers

### Error Handling
- [ ] Network errors communicated accessibly
- [ ] Form validation errors clearly explained
- [ ] 404/error pages maintain accessibility standards
- [ ] JavaScript errors don't break accessibility features
