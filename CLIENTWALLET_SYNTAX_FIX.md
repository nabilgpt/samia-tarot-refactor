# ClientWallet.jsx Syntax Error Fix

## Issue
The ClientWallet.jsx file had an unterminated template literal on line 723:

```javascript
{method.fees.range && `
```

This caused a React Babel parser error preventing the application from building.

## Root Cause
During previous edits to implement the restricted payment methods system, the template literal was started but never closed, creating a syntax error.

## Solution
Fixed the unterminated template literal by properly completing the payment method fees display logic:

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
{method.fees.range && `
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
{method.fees.range && `$${method.fees.range}`}
{method.fees.description && method.fees.description}
```

## Verification
- ✅ **Build successful**: `npm run build` completes without errors
- ✅ **No syntax errors**: File parses correctly
- ✅ **Payment methods functionality**: All restricted payment methods features remain intact

## Files Modified
- `src/components/Client/ClientWallet.jsx` - Fixed unterminated template literal and completed payment method fees display

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - The syntax error has been fixed and the application builds successfully.
