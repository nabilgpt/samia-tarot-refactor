# Enhanced Providers System Migration Instructions

## Issue Resolution
The migration was failing because the original SQL used `type` as a column name, which is a reserved keyword in PostgreSQL. This has been fixed by changing the column name to `provider_type`.

## How to Execute the Migration

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project: samia-tarot
3. Go to the SQL Editor tab
4. Copy and paste the contents of `fix-migration-type-error.sql` into the editor
5. Click "Run" to execute the migration

### Option 2: Using psql (if available)
```bash
psql -h db.klcmjxbqbkzwpqdhqbxz.supabase.co -p 5432 -U postgres -d postgres -f fix-migration-type-error.sql
```

### Option 3: Using the Backend API
The migration can also be executed through the backend API once the enhanced providers endpoints are active.

## What the Migration Creates
- **providers** table: Main providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- **provider_services** table: Services offered by each provider
- **provider_models** table: Models available from each provider  
- **provider_secrets** table: Encrypted API keys and secrets
- **Indexes** for performance optimization
- **Triggers** for automatic timestamp updates
- **Seed data** for 8 major providers with their services and models

## Expected Results
After successful execution, you should see:
- 8 providers created (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Stripe, ElevenLabs, Twilio, AWS, Supabase)
- 12 services created
- 10 models created
- 0 secrets initially (will be added through the dashboard)

## Verification
Run this query to verify the migration succeeded:
```sql
SELECT 'providers' as table_name, count(*) as record_count FROM providers
UNION ALL
SELECT 'provider_services' as table_name, count(*) as record_count FROM provider_services
UNION ALL
SELECT 'provider_models' as table_name, count(*) as record_count FROM provider_models
UNION ALL
SELECT 'provider_secrets' as table_name, count(*) as record_count FROM provider_secrets;
```

Expected output:
```
table_name        | record_count
providers         | 8
provider_services | 12
provider_models   | 10
provider_secrets  | 0
```

## Next Steps
Once the migration is complete:
1. Update the todo status to mark database migration as completed
2. Test the enhanced providers API endpoints
3. Continue with the frontend implementation
4. Test the complete system integration

## Files Updated
- `database/enhanced-providers-system-migration.sql` - Fixed column name from `type` to `provider_type`
- `src/services/enhancedProvidersService.js` - Updated to use `provider_type`
- `src/components/Dashboard/EnhancedProviders/ProvidersTab.jsx` - Updated to use `provider_type`
