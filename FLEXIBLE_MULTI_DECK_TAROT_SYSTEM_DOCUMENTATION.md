## üí≥ PAYMENT INTEGRATION

### Card Reveal Logic

#### For Regular Sessions
1. Client selects spread and asks question
2. Reader draws cards (face down)
3. **Payment required** before any reveals
4. Post-payment: Client can reveal cards sequentially
5. Reader provides interpretation

#### For Live Call Sessions
1. Real-time interaction enabled
2. Both reader and client can interact
3. No payment gating during live session
4. Payment handled through booking system

#### Payment States
- **`unpaid`** - No card reveals allowed
- **`paid`** - Full card access granted
- **`live_call`** - Real-time interaction enabled
- **`refunded`** - Session invalidated

---

## üî• BURN/DISCARD SYSTEM

### Burn Functionality

#### Who Can Burn Cards
- **Readers**: Full burn permissions for their sessions
- **Admins**: System-level burn capabilities
- **Super Admins**: Unrestricted burn access

#### Burn Process
1. Reader identifies card to burn
2. Optional burn reason provided
3. Card marked as `is_burned: true`
4. Timestamp and user ID logged
5. Card becomes non-revealable
6. Position remains in spread (marked as burned)

#### Burn Tracking
```sql
UPDATE tarot_spread_cards SET
  is_burned = true,
  burned_at = NOW(),
  burned_by_user_id = $1,
  burn_reason = $2
WHERE session_id = $3 AND position = $4;
```

### Use Cases
- **Energy mismatch**: Card doesn't feel right for reading
- **Deck cleansing**: Removing negative energy
- **Client request**: Specific card feels uncomfortable
- **Reader intuition**: Professional judgment call

  message: 'Too many tarot requests'
});
```

### Permission Validation

#### Critical Checks
```javascript
// Check if admin can delete users (should be false)
const canDeleteUsers = () => {
  return userPermissions.delete_users === true;
};

if (formData.role === 'super_admin' && !canCreateSuperAdmin()) {
  throw new Error('Insufficient permissions');
}
```
