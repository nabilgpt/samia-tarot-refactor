# 🚫 **Deck Form Scroll Removal - Perfect Match with Spread Form**

## 📋 **Issue Identified**

After fixing the AddDeckModal positioning, there were still **internal scroll containers** within the AddNewDeckForm component itself, causing scrolling behavior that didn't match the AddNewSpreadForm.

---

## 🎯 **Problem Analysis**

### **AddNewSpreadForm** ✅
- **No scroll containers**: Content flows naturally
- **Page-level scrolling only**: Smooth, unified experience
- **No height restrictions**: All content visible without internal scrolling

### **AddNewDeckForm** ❌ (Before Fix)
- **2 scroll containers found**:
  1. Cards list: `max-h-96 overflow-y-auto` 
  2. Readers list: `max-h-64 overflow-y-auto`
- **Internal scrolling**: Disrupted user experience
- **Height restrictions**: Content hidden behind scroll areas

---

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied**

### **Fix 1: Cards List Section**
```jsx
// BEFORE (With internal scroll)
<div className="max-h-96 overflow-y-auto space-y-3">

// AFTER (No scroll - natural flow)
<div className="space-y-3">
```

### **Fix 2: Readers List Section**
```jsx
// BEFORE (With internal scroll)  
<div className="max-h-64 overflow-y-auto space-y-2">

// AFTER (No scroll - natural flow)
<div className="space-y-2">
```
