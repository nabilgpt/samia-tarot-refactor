# ENTERPRISE USER RESET SYSTEM - SAMIA TAROT

## üéØ Overview

This document describes the **Enterprise-Grade User Reset System** for SAMIA TAROT, designed to safely and efficiently resolve foreign key constraint violations and reset user accounts in development and staging environments.

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE

**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS SYSTEM PERFORMS DESTRUCTIVE DATABASE OPERATIONS**
- Only use in development and staging environments
- Production execution is blocked by design
- Always backup database before execution
- Requires multiple confirmation steps

## üìã Problem Summary

### Original Issue
Foreign key constraint violations when attempting to delete user profiles:
```
ERROR: 23503: update or delete on table "profiles" violates foreign key constraint 
"configuration_change_log_changed_by_fkey" on table "configuration_change_log"
```

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Multiple Foreign Key References**: Dozens of tables reference `profiles(id)`
2. **Mixed Nullability**: Some columns are NOT NULL, others are nullable
3. **Complex Dependencies**: System tables with audit trails and configuration logs
4. **Security Weaknesses**: Original script had hardcoded values and poor error handling

## üîß Solution Architecture

### Enterprise-Grade Features

#### 1. **Intelligent Foreign Key Detection**
```sql
-- Automatically discovers ALL foreign key relationships
SELECT DISTINCT
    tc.table_name,
    kcu.column_name,
    tc.constraint_name,
    CASE WHEN col.is_nullable = 'YES' THEN true ELSE false END as is_nullable
FROM information_schema.table_constraints tc 
-- ... (full query in script)
```

#### 2. **Smart Cleanup Strategy**
- **Nullable Columns**: Set to NULL
- **NOT NULL Columns**: Transfer ownership to main admin
- **Error Handling**: Continue on failure, log all operations

#### 3. **Security Enhancements**
- **Environment Validation**: Blocks production execution
- **Unique Passwords**: Each user gets different temporary password
- **Parameterized Values**: No hardcoded IDs
- **Audit Logging**: Complete operation tracking

#### 4. **Transaction Safety**
- **Atomic Operations**: All-or-nothing execution
- **Backup Creation**: Temporary backup of critical data
- **Rollback Capability**: Automatic rollback on errors
- **Verification Steps**: Post-execution validation

## üìÇ Files Created

### 1. `database/enterprise-user-reset.sql`
**Purpose**: Main SQL script with enterprise-grade features
**Key Features**:
- Environment safety checks
- Intelligent foreign key cleanup
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Secure user creation
- Post-execution verification

### 2. `scripts/execute-enterprise-reset.js`
**Purpose**: Safe JavaScript wrapper for script execution
**Key Features**:
- Environment validation
- User confirmation prompts
- Progress monitoring
- Error handling
- Post-reset instructions

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Method 1: Direct SQL Execution (Recommended)
```bash
# Set environment
export ENVIRONMENT=development

# Execute using psql
psql -h [host] -p [port] -U [user] -d [database] -f database/enterprise-user-reset.sql
```

### Method 2: JavaScript Wrapper
```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install @supabase/supabase-js

# Run with safety checks
node scripts/execute-enterprise-reset.js
```

### Method 3: Manual Step-by-Step
1. **Review Script**: Examine `database/enterprise-user-reset.sql`
2. **Modify Variables**: Update IDs if needed
3. **Test Environment**: Ensure not production
4. **Execute Sections**: Run step by step for maximum control

## üìä Expected Results

### Before Execution
```
Profiles: 6 (including duplicates)
Foreign Key Violations: Multiple constraint errors
Authentication: Broken due to duplicate profiles
```

### After Execution
```
Profiles: 6 (clean, unique accounts)
Foreign Key Violations: None
Authentication: Fully functional
Audit Trail: Complete operation log
```

### New User Accounts
| Email | Role | Temp Password | Status |
|-------|------|---------------|--------|
| info@samiatarot.com | super_admin | TempPass!2024 | Active |
| admin@samiatarot.com | admin | TempPass!2025 | Active |
| reader1@samiatarot.com | reader | TempPass!2026 | Active |
| reader2@samiatarot.com | reader | TempPass!2027 | Active |
| client@samiatarot.com | client | TempPass!2028 | Active |
| monitor@samiatarot.com | monitor | TempPass!2029 | Active |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### 1. **Environment Protection**
- Production execution blocked by design
- Environment validation at multiple levels
- Confirmation prompts required

### 2. **Password Security**
- Unique bcrypt hashes for each user
- 12 salt rounds for strong encryption
- Temporary passwords require immediate change

### 3. **Audit Trail**
- Complete operation logging
- Error tracking and reporting
- Step-by-step progress monitoring

### 4. **Data Protection**
- Temporary backup creation
- Transaction safety with rollback
- Verification of results

## üìã Post-Reset Checklist

### Immediate Actions (Required)
- [ ] Verify all user accounts created successfully
- [ ] Test authentication for each role
- [ ] Force password changes on first login
- [ ] Validate Super Admin Dashboard access

### Security Hardening (Recommended)
- [ ] Enable 2FA for admin accounts
- [ ] Review and update user permissions
- [ ] Monitor audit logs for unusual activity
- [ ] Update password policies if needed

### System Validation (Testing)
- [ ] Test all dashboard functionalities
- [ ] Verify API authentication works
- [ ] Check role-based access controls
- [ ] Validate database integrity

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **Script Execution Blocked**
```
ERROR: SAFETY: This script is blocked from running in production environment
```
**Solution**: Change environment variable to 'development' or 'staging'

#### 2. **Foreign Key Still Exists**
```
ERROR: update or delete on table "profiles" violates foreign key constraint
```
**Solution**: 
- Check if new foreign key relationships were added
- Run discovery query to find missing references
- Update script to handle new tables

#### 3. **Permission Denied**
```
ERROR: permission denied for table profiles
```
**Solution**: Ensure using SERVICE_ROLE_KEY with admin privileges

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting:
```sql
\set VERBOSITY verbose
```

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Execution Time
- **Small Database** (<10k records): 30-60 seconds
- **Medium Database** (10k-100k records): 2-5 minutes  
- **Large Database** (>100k records): 5-15 minutes

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: Minimal (temp tables only)
- **CPU**: Moderate during foreign key operations
- **I/O**: Heavy during cleanup phase

### Optimization Tips
1. Run during low-traffic periods
2. Monitor database performance
3. Consider breaking into smaller chunks for very large databases

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] Zero foreign key constraint violations
- [ ] All profiles have encrypted passwords
- [ ] Database integrity maintained
- [ ] Audit log shows successful completion

### Functional Validation  
- [ ] Authentication works for all roles
- [ ] Super Admin Dashboard accessible
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly

- [ ] Temporary passwords are unique
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Access controls working properly
- [ ] Audit trail is complete

## üìû Support and Maintenance
