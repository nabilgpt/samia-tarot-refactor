# JSX Syntax Quick Fix Guide

## Issue
The JSX parser is reporting an error in `SpreadVisualEditor.jsx` at line 866:
```
Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for <>.
```

## Root Cause
The `renderEditor` function is returning a JSX fragment `<>...</>` but the structure isn't properly balanced due to the complex nesting.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Restart Development Server (Recommended)
Often, Vite's JSX parser gets confused with complex fragments. Simply restart:

```bash
# In your frontend terminal
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Manual JSX Fix
If restart doesn't work, the issue is in the `renderEditor` function around line 550. The function needs proper JSX fragment structure.

**The problem**: The fragment `<>...</>` contains complex nested JSX that's causing parser confusion.

**The solution**: Wrap the content in a proper React.Fragment or div container.

## Expected Result
- ✅ No JSX parsing errors
- ✅ Vite dev server compiles cleanly
- ✅ SpreadVisualEditor component loads properly
- ✅ Both Grid and Freeform editors accessible

## If Problems Persist
1. Check if there are any unclosed JSX tags
2. Verify all conditional rendering has proper `{}` wrapping
3. Look for missing closing tags in the Position Edit Modal section
4. Consider temporarily commenting out the Position Edit Modal to isolate the issue

## Context
This JSX error is preventing the frontend from loading the spread manager, even though the main database issue is the missing `spread_cards` table columns. Fix the database first, then the JSX will be less critical.

**Priority**: Fix database schema first, then address JSX if server restart doesn't resolve it.
