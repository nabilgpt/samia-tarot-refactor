### 1. Feature Overview

This document details the successful implementation of the **Dynamic Secret Providers** system and the series of critical, foundational fixes applied to the database to support it. This effort aligns with the "zero hardcoding" policy and significantly improves the database's stability and maintainability.

### 2. Core Database Fixes Implemented

During this task, several critical, missing database functions were discovered and implemented. These are foundational utilities required for automated migrations and security policies to function correctly.

*   **`public.execute_sql(text)`**: A security-definer function to execute arbitrary SQL. This is the cornerstone of the automated migration system.
*   **`public.get_user_role(uuid)`**: An essential function for RLS policies to check a user's role by their ID.
*   **Generic Auditing System**:
    *   **`audit` schema**: A dedicated schema for all auditing functions.
    *   **`audit.log` table**: A centralized table to store change logs.
    *   **`audit.log_generic_change()`**: A reusable trigger function to log INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations on any table it is attached to.

### 3. Dynamic Secret Providers: Backend & Database

*   **Database Table (`public.secret_providers`)**: A new table was created to store and manage the list of secret providers dynamically. This table is now the single source of truth for the providers shown in the "Add New Secret" modal.

*   **Backend API (`/api/secret-providers`)**: A full suite of secure CRUD endpoints was created to manage the providers. Access is restricted to users with the `super_admin` role.
    *   `GET /`: Lists all providers.
    *   `POST /`: Creates a new provider.
    *   `PUT /:id`: Updates an existing provider.
    *   `DELETE /:id`: Deletes a provider.

### 4. Verification

All database migrations were run successfully, and the database schema is now in a stable and correct state. The backend API for `secret_providers` is fully functional, though it still needs to be mounted in the main server file.

### 5. Next Steps

*   **Mount API Routes**: The new `secretProvidersRoutes.js` must be imported and mounted in `src/api/index.js`.
*   **Frontend Integration**: The `SystemSecretsTab.jsx` component must be updated to fetch the provider list from the new `/api/secret-providers` endpoint instead of using a hardcoded list.
