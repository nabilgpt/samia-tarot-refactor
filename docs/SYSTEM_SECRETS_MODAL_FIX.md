### 1. Problem Description

The "Add New Secret" modal in the **System Secrets Management** tab (`Super Admin Dashboard`) was not displaying correctly. When the modal was opened, it only showed a provider dropdown and the "Save" / "Cancel" buttons, but was completely missing the necessary input fields for the `Secret Key` and `Secret Value`.

This was a critical UI bug that prevented administrators from adding new secrets to the system, despite the underlying state management and validation logic being present. The validation error "Secret Key and Value are required" would appear, but the user had no fields to enter the required data.

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

The root cause was a simple omission in the JSX of the `AddEditSecretModal` component within `src/components/Admin/SystemSecretsTab.jsx`. The form structure was incomplete and did not contain the `<input>` and `<textarea>` elements required for data entry. The component's state (`formData`) was correctly defined to handle these values, but they were never rendered in the UI.

### 3. Solution Implemented

The issue was resolved by adding the missing form fields directly into the `AddEditSecretModal` component's JSX.

**File Modified:**
*   `src/components/Admin/SystemSecretsTab.jsx`

**Specific Changes:**
*   **Added "Secret Key" Input:** An `<input type="text">` field was added for `secret_key`. This field is disabled in "Edit Mode" to prevent accidental changes to a key that might be linked to a provider.
*   **Added "Secret Value" Input:** An `<input type="password">` field was added for `secret_value`. Using `type="password"` ensures the sensitive value is masked during entry.
*   **Added "Category" Input:** An `<input type="text">` field was added for `category`.
*   **Added "Description" Textarea:** A `<textarea>` was added for a user-friendly `description` of the secret.
*   **Validation:** All fields were correctly linked to the existing `formData` state and `handleChange` handler. The `required` attribute was added to the key and value fields to enforce browser-level validation.

### 4. How to Verify the Fix

1.  Navigate to the **Super Admin Dashboard**.
2.  Go to the **System Settings** tab.
3.  Click on the **"Add New Secret"** button.
4.  **Verification:** The modal should now appear correctly with all the input fields: `Select a Provider`, `Secret Key`, `Secret Value`, `Category`, and `Description`.
5.  The form should be fully functional, allowing for the creation of new secrets.
