### 1. Feature Overview

This document details the successful frontend integration of the **Dynamic Secret Providers** system into the `SystemSecretsTab.jsx` component. This completes the feature by connecting the user interface to the backend API and database changes, fully realizing the "zero hardcoding" policy for secret management.

### 2. Implementation Details

The integration was performed in the `src/components/Admin/SystemSecretsTab.jsx` component. Due to persistent issues with automated refactoring tools, the final implementation was delivered as a complete, new file (`SystemSecretsTab_NEW.jsx`) to ensure a clean and correct result.

#### 2.1. State Management
- A new state variable, `secretProviders`, was added to store the list of dynamic providers fetched from the API.
- The primary data loading function, `loadData`, was updated to fetch secrets, AI providers, and the new secret providers in parallel using `Promise.all`.

#### 2.2. "Add/Edit Secret" Modal Logic
- **Dynamic Provider Dropdown**: The `<select>` element for providers is now dynamically populated by mapping over the `secretProviders` state.
- **Dynamic Category Dropdown**: The category dropdown is now populated by creating a unique set of categories from both the existing secrets and the new secret providers, ensuring all possible categories are available for selection.
- **Autofill & Read-only Logic**:
    - An `onChange` handler (`handleProviderChange`) was added to the provider dropdown.
    - When a provider is selected, it checks if `default_key` exists for that provider.
    - If `default_key` exists, the "Secret Key" input field is automatically populated with this value and set to `readOnly`.
    - If the user selects "None" or a provider without a `default_key`, the "Secret Key" field remains editable.
    - The provider's default `category` is also auto-selected.

#### 2.3. Filtering
- The main provider filter on the secrets list was updated to use the dynamic `secretProviders` data, allowing users to filter the list by the newly managed providers.

### 3. Verification Steps

1.  Navigate to the **Super Admin Dashboard** -> **System Secrets** tab.
2.  Click the "Add Secret" button.
3.  The "Provider" dropdown in the modal should now be populated with the list of providers from the `secret_providers` table (e.g., "OpenAI", "Stripe", "Google Translate").
4.  Select "OpenAI". The "Secret Key" field should autofill with `OPENAI_API_KEY` and become read-only. The "Category" should switch to "AI".
5.  Select "None (Custom Secret)". The "Secret Key" field should become editable.
6.  Confirm that all CRUD operations (Create, Update, Delete) for secrets continue to function correctly.
