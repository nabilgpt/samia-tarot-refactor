## 3. Detailed Retention Schedules

### 3.1 User Account Data

#### 3.1.1 Active Account Period
```sql
-- Core profile data (retained while account active)
SELECT 'ACTIVE' as retention_status, 
       count(*) as profiles_count
FROM profiles 
WHERE created_at > now() - interval '3 years';
```

**Retention Rule**: No automatic deletion while account remains active  
**Manual Deletion**: User-requested account closure  
**Data Included**:
- Basic profile information (name, email, demographics)
- Account preferences and settings
- Service subscriptions and preferences
- Authentication credentials and verification status

#### 3.1.2 Post-Closure Grace Period (30 Days)
```sql
-- Profiles marked for deletion but in grace period
SELECT profile_id, marked_for_deletion_at,
       now() - marked_for_deletion_at as grace_period
FROM profiles 
WHERE marked_for_deletion = true
  AND marked_for_deletion_at > now() - interval '30 days';
```

**Retention Rule**: 30-day recovery period after account closure  
**Purpose**: Allow account recovery for accidental closures  
**Access**: Account disabled but data retained  
**Final Deletion**: Automatic after 30 days

### 3.2 Service Interaction Data

#### 3.2.1 Order Lifecycle Retention
```sql
-- Order retention by status and age
SELECT status, 
       count(*) as order_count,
       avg(extract(days from now() - delivered_at)) as avg_age_days
FROM orders 
WHERE delivered_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY status;
```

**Retention Schedules by Status**:
- **Active Orders** (`new`, `assigned`, `in_progress`): Until completion
- **Pending Approval** (`awaiting_approval`): Until approved/rejected + 30 days
- **Completed Orders** (`delivered`): 2 years from delivery date
- **Cancelled Orders** (`cancelled`): 1 year from cancellation
- **Disputed Orders**: Until dispute resolution + 1 year

#### 3.2.2 Media Asset Retention
```sql
-- Media retention by type and linkage
SELECT m.kind,
       COUNT(*) as file_count,
       SUM(m.bytes) as total_bytes,
       AVG(EXTRACT(days FROM now() - m.created_at)) as avg_age_days
FROM media_assets m
LEFT JOIN orders o1 ON m.id = o1.input_media_id
LEFT JOIN orders o2 ON m.id = o2.output_media_id  
GROUP BY m.kind;
```

**Media Type Retention Rules**:

| Media Type | Retention Period | Business Justification |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **User Questions** (input audio/image) | 90 days post-delivery | Quality assurance, disputes |
| **Reading Outputs** (response audio) | 60 days post-delivery | Client access, re-delivery |
| **Call Recordings** | 90 days post-session | Training, quality control |
| **System/Admin Media** | Per business need | Operational requirements |
| **Horoscope Content** | 60 days maximum | Content freshness policy |

#### 3.2.3 Communication Records
```sql
-- Communication record retention by type
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN phone IS NOT NULL THEN 'SMS'
    WHEN provider_ref LIKE 'email%' THEN 'Email'
    ELSE 'Other'
  END as comm_type,
  status,
  count(*) as record_count
FROM phone_verifications 
WHERE created_at > now() - interval '90 days'
GROUP BY comm_type, status;
```

**Communication Retention**:
- **SMS/Phone Verifications**: 90 days
- **Email Communications**: 1 year (support context)
- **Push Notifications**: 30 days (delivery logs only)
- **System Messages**: 90 days

### 3.3 Financial Data Retention

#### 3.3.1 Payment Transaction Records
```sql
-- Payment record retention compliance check
SELECT 
  extract(year from created_at) as transaction_year,
  count(*) as transaction_count,
  sum(amount_cents) as total_amount_cents,
  CASE 
    WHEN extract(year from created_at) >= extract(year from now()) - 7 THEN 'RETAIN'
    ELSE 'ELIGIBLE_FOR_DELETION'
  END as retention_status
FROM payment_transactions
GROUP BY extract(year from created_at)
ORDER BY transaction_year DESC;
```

**Legal Requirement**: 7-year retention for tax compliance  
**Scope**: All financial transactions, refunds, chargebacks  
**Exceptions**: User-requested deletion (anonymize but retain financial aggregates)

#### 3.3.2 Cost Tracking Data
```sql
-- Internal cost tracking retention
SELECT service_name,
       count(*) as usage_records,
       sum(cost_cents) as total_cost,
       max(usage_date) as latest_usage
FROM finops_cost_usage 
WHERE usage_date >= now() - interval '2 years'
GROUP BY service_name;
```

**Business Data Retention**: 2 years for operational analysis  
**Purpose**: Budget planning, cost optimization, vendor management  
**Privacy Impact**: Internal business data, no direct personal data

#### 3.4.1 Audit Trail Retention
```sql
-- Audit log retention by event type and age
SELECT event,
       count(*) as event_count,
       min(created_at) as oldest_event,
       max(created_at) as newest_event,
       CASE 
         WHEN min(created_at) < now() - interval '3 years' THEN 'ELIGIBLE_FOR_ANONYMIZATION'
         ELSE 'ACTIVE_RETENTION'
       END as retention_status
FROM audit_log
GROUP BY event
ORDER BY oldest_event;
```

**Audit Trail Policy**:
- **Security Events**: 3 years full retention, then anonymize
- **Financial Events**: 7 years (aligned with financial records)
- **User Actions**: 1 year full retention, then anonymize
- **System Events**: 2 years

#### 3.4.2 Moderation & Safety Records
```sql
-- Moderation action retention analysis
SELECT action,
       count(*) as action_count,
       avg(extract(days from now() - created_at)) as avg_age_days,
       count(case when created_at < now() - interval '5 years' then 1 end) as old_records
FROM moderation_actions
GROUP BY action;
```

**Safety Data Retention**: 5 years for pattern analysis  
**Purpose**: Safety enforcement, appeal handling, regulatory compliance  
**Review Process**: Annual assessment for continued relevance
