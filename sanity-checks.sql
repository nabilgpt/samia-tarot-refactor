-- SANITY CHECKS â€” SAMIA TAROT  
-- Pre-canary validation queries
-- maintainable & short â€” preserve theme integrity

-- 1. DECK CARDS PARITY CHECK
-- =====================================================

-- Total deck cards in system
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_deck_cards FROM deck_cards;

-- Verify proper card distribution (78 face + 1 back per complete deck)

WHERE generation_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY generation_date
ORDER BY generation_date DESC;

-- =====================================================
-- 7. RLS POLICY COVERAGE
-- =====================================================

-- Verify critical tables have RLS enabled
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  rowsecurity as rls_enabled,
  -- Count policies per table
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies WHERE pg_policies.tablename = pg_tables.tablename) as policy_count
